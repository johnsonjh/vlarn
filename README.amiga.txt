Amiga ULarn release notes
-------------------------
(or "Help! How to I get this thing running?")

ULarn for the Amiga requires an AGA amiga to run. Forget trying on an A500.

ULarn is designed to work in a high res interlaced (or similar) screen mode.
Don't try an running in a LOWRES screenmode. It will work, but not all of
the text will be visible.

The Amiga ULarn uses rather a lot of stack space.
If running from the shell I recommend using the command:
  stack 100000
before running ularn.
