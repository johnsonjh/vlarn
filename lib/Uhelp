;    Welcome to the game of Ularn.  At this moment, you face a great problem.
Your daughter has contracted a strange disease and none of your home remedies
seems to have any effect.  You sense that she is in mortal danger and you must
try to save her.  Time ago you heard of a land of great danger and opportunity.
Perhaps here is the solution you need.

    It has been said that there once was a great magician who called himself
Polinneaus.  Many years ago, after having many miraculous successes, Polinneaus
retired to the caverns of Ularn, where he devoted most of his time to the
creation of magic.   Rumors have it that one day Polinneaus set out to dispel
an attacking army in a forest some distance to the north.  It is believed that
there he met his demise.

    The caverns of Ularn, it is thought, must be magnificent in design
and contain much magic and treasure.  One option you have is to undertake a
journey into these caverns.


    Good Luck!  (You're going to need it.)

                     ^[[7mSpecial Notes^[[m
When dropping gold, if you type '*' as your amount, all your gold gets dropped.
In general, typing in '*' means all of what your interested in.  This is true
when visiting the bank, or when contributing at altars.

When in the store, trading post, school, or home, an ^[[7m<escape>^[[m will get you out.

When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can cast, type '^[[7mD^[[m' as
the first letter of your spell.  The available list of spells will be shown,
after which you may enter the spell code.  This only works on the 1st letter
of the spell you are casting.  You may also type '^[[7\^[[m' at any time - this will
show all the spells you know, as well as all the potions and scrolls you have
encountered and identified so far.

	       ^[[7mExplanation of the Ularn scoreboard facility^[[m

    Ularn supports TWO scoreboards, one for winners, and one for deceased
characters.  Each player is allowed one slot on each scoreboard, if the score
is in the top ten for that scoreboard.  This design helps ensure that frequent 
players of Ularn do not hog the scoreboard and gives more players a chance 
for glory.  Level of difficulty is also noted on the scoreboards and this 
takes precedence over score for determining what entry is on the scoreboard.  
For example: if "Satyr, the Ularn God" has a score of 128003 on the scoreboard 
at diff 0, then his game at diff 1 and a score of 4112 would replace his 
previous entry on the scoreboard.  Note that when a player dies, his inventory 
is stored in the scoreboard so that everyone can see what items the player had
at the time of his death.
