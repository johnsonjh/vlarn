Amiga ULarn Release Notes
-------------------------

(or "Help! How to I get this thing running?")

ULarn for the Amiga requires an AGA Amiga to run.
Forget trying on an A500.

ULarn is designed to work in a high res interlaced (or similar) screen mode.
Don't try an running in a LOWRES screen-mode.
It will work, but not all of the text will be visible.

The Amiga ULarn uses rather a lot of stack space.
If running from the shell, first run the command:

stack 100000
