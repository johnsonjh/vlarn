Compiling/Installing TTY VLarn
------------------------------

VLarn should compile on any Unix like OS (Linux, NetBSD, Solaris, etc).

The code has only been tested on GCC on Unix based systems.
It may or may not work on other compilers.

It has been tested on the following systems:

Pentium 4 running Red Hat Linux 7.1
Amiga A4000/040 running NetBSD 1.5.2
Sun UltraSparc running Solaris 2.5.2

There is no configure script provided (or necessary.)

Some Unix systems may need 'dos2unix' (or an equivalent command to strip ^M)
to be run on the source files and the Makefile before compiling. 

NOTE: Source installation is the only form I support for Unix systems.
      I do not release VLarn executables for the X11 version as there
      are way too many variants.

To compile and install VLarn:

1. Edit Makefile.TTY to set system specific include and library paths.
   This may not be necessary as the default include path is the most
   common location for the necessary include files.
   Change the INSTALL_PATH and LIB_PATH in to specify the desired install 
   location.
   Set LIB to the curses library you are using (usually -lncurses or -lcurses)

2. Edit config.h
   a) Set LIBDIR to the install location of the lib directory
   b) Make sure that only the appropriate O/S define is uncommented.
      (UNIX_TTY for the TTY version).

4. Compile using make -f Makefile.TTY

5. Install using make -f Makefile.TTY install
