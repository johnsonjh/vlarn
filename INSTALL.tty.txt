Compiling/Installing TTY ULarn
------------------------------

ULarn should compile on any Unix like O/S (Linux, NetBSD, solaris etc).
The code has only been tested on gcc as it is the only compiler I use
on unix based systems. It may or may not work on other compilers.

I have tested it on the following systems:

Pentium-4 running Red Hat Linux 7.1
Amiga A4000/040 running NetBSD 1.5.2
Sun UltraSparc running Solaris 2.5.2

There is no auto configure script provided. I usually find them more 
trouble than they are worth. For example, the configure script for 
ularn 1.5pl4 (the old TTY version) made a right balls up on the
UltraSparc Solaris system, and I ended up having to manually configure
everything anyway.

Some unix systems may need dos2unix (or equivalent command to strip ^M)
to be run on the source files and the makefile before compiling. 
The Sun Ultrasparc did, linux didn't.

NOTE: Source installation is the only form I support for unix systems.
      I do not release ULarn executables for the X11 version as there
      are way too many variants.

To compile and install ULarn:

1. Edit makefile.tty to set system specific include and library paths.
   This may not be necessary as the default include path is the most
   common location for the necessary include files.
   Change the INSTALL_PATH and LIB_PATH in to specify the desired install 
   location.
   Set LIB to the curses library you are using (probably -lncurses for linux
   or -lcurses for other unix variants).

2. Edit config.h
   a) Set LIBDIR to the install location of the lib directory
   b) Make sure that only the appropriate O/S define is uncommented.
      (UNIX_TTY for the TTY version).

4. Compile using make -f Makefile.tty

5. Install using make -f Makefile.tty install
