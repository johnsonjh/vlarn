/* =============================================================================
 * PROGRAM:  CODE LIBRARY
 * FILENAME: smart_menu.h
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This module provides a set of functions to make menu handling for
 * Intuition easier.
 * A much simpler set of data structures for simple text menu are used.
 *
 * Each menu on is specified in an array of SmartMenuItem.
 * The last element of the array should have all fields set to NULL to mark
 * the end of the menu.
 * Each SmartMenuItem specifies the Text, colour and command sequence to use
 * for the menu item. It also specifies the function to be called when the
 * menu item is selected.
 * Note: The same structure is used for menus and submenus.
 *
 * The menus on the menu bar are specified in an array of SmartMenu.
 * This array should also be terminated with an entry with all elements set to
 * NULL.
 *
 * The menu structure specified in the array of SmartMenu is set to a window
 * using the MakeMenuStructure function. This function alocates and sets up the
 * Intuition structures required for the menu and then assigns the menu to the
 * specified window.
 *
 * The window containing the menu should have the IDCMP_MENUPICK flag set so
 * it will receive menu events.
 * When a menu event is received for the window, call DoMenuSelection to
 * with the Code field of the IntuiMessage handle the event. This will call
 * the specified callback function of the event picked.
 *
 * NOTE: This module can currently only handle the menu for one window at a
 *       time.

 * =============================================================================
 * EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
 *
 * MenuNil  : The Null action event handler for menu items that do nothing.
 * MenuQuit : The default Quit application menu handler. Sets the Quit flag.
 *            This should also be called when the application exits if it is not
 *            used to handle the Quit menu item.
 * MakeMenuStructure : Makes the Intuition menu structure and assigns the menu
 *                     into a window.
 * DoMenuSelection   : Handles the menu selection events.
